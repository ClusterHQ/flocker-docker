# Flocker Docker Plugin

The Flocker Docker plugin is a [Docker volumes plugin](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/experimental/plugins_volume.md), connecting Docker on a host directly to Flocker, where Flocker agents will be running on the same host and hooked up to the Flocker control service.

## Documentation

Please refer to [the Flocker Docker plugin docs](https://docs.clusterhq.com/en/latest/labs/).
